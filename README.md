**DESCRIPTION**
---------------
This is my educational work to study program language C.
The aim of the work is to learn how to:
* work with pointers
* work with string
* work fast with file input

**NOTES**
---------
While writing this program it was decided to sort Shakespeare instead of Pushkin to work with english letters. I deal the problem of russian letters in my work with [My_compiler](https://github.com/s-a-v-a-n-n-a/My_compiler).
